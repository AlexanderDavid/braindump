      <description>This document details an approach to research (or any project with an uncertain outcome) and specifically what order to attack your actionable items in
Warm Up It is often that when starting a project you set out with a TODO list of tasks. The order that most people (myself included) perform these tasks in is easiest to hardest.
However the problem with this is that if you get 80% of the tasks done and then realize that the remaining two tasks are impossible to complete while keeping the system you have to scrap all the work that you have done.</description>

      <description>One interesting thing about this book is that each chapter starts with a dialog between the turtle and Achilles from Zeno&amp;rsquo;s paradox.
Gödel, Escher, Bach is a book about strange loops. Self referential structures that the author supposes that these strange loops are the basis of all consciousness. The author starts this book with an overview of all three Gödel, Escher, and Bach. Then moves onto an introduction to formal languages and how their isomorphism can be real things in the world.</description>

      <description>tags Motion Planning  Velocity Obstacles are a way to determine collision velocities for agents.
Slides Starting with Cartesian Imagine starting with a Cartesian space where there are two agents, \(A\) and \(B\).
  Now if you translate this space so that \(A\) is centered at the origin and \(B\) is at position \(x_{b}-x_{a}\).
  Now if you deflate \(A\) so that it is a single point, then inflate \(B\) so it has a has a radius of \(r_{a}+r_{b}\) (because \(A\) is a point and the radius has to be increased).</description>

      <description>Purpose Used to shift the front gears
attached with clamp or bracket
Forms a box around the chain that attaches with a parallelogram to the mounting bracket
Linkage is held and moved with the pull of the cable
Springs back when the cable is tension is removed
Shifting only occurs when the rider is pedaling
The derailleur pushes the cage onto the cog above or below the current one
Has H and L limit screws to stop the limits of the travel</description>

      <description>tags Python  Concurrent Futures High level wrapper for async execution of callables. The basic idea is that execution is passed to either threads (with ThreadPoolExecutor) or processes (with ProcessPollExecutor). Both of them expose the same methods and inheret from the abstract Executor class.
To submit a single fuction for async work:
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor: future = executor.submit(pow, 2, 5) print(future.result()) Can also map a single function over a list of iterables:</description>
