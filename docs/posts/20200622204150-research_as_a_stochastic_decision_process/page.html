      <h1>Research as a Stochastic Decision Process</h1>
      <p>This document details an approach to research (or any project with an uncertain outcome) and specifically what order to attack your actionable items in</p>
<h2 id="warm-up">Warm Up</h2>
<p>It is often that when starting a project you set out with a TODO list of tasks. The order that most people (myself included) perform these tasks in is easiest to hardest.</p>
<p>However the problem with this is that if you get 80% of the tasks done and then realize that the remaining two tasks are impossible to complete while keeping the system you have to scrap all the work that you have done.</p>
<p>The author postulates that tasks should be prioritized by their likelihood to fail (larger likelihoods first) and based on the time they will take (shorter tasks first)</p>
<h2 id="a-better-strategy-sorting-by-information-rate">A Better Strategy: Sorting by Information Rate</h2>
<p>A more formal strategy is to do tasks by sorting them based on most informative by unit time. The author lays out two strategies for measuring informativeness.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Expected Time Saved
Higher &ldquo;informative&rdquo; tasks give a higher amount of time saved if they fail.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    Situation: All steps of a project take equal time to complete and have an 80% success rate

    Task Order: Do the shortest tasks first. This means that if a task fails then all the longer tasks haven&#39;t been done yet and the time is saved.
</code></pre></div></li>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    Situation: Task 1 (90% success, 30 minutes), Task 2 (40% success and 4 hours)

    Do easy task first. If it failes we save 240 minutes. (10% * 240 = 24 minutes saved). If we did the opposite and did the hard task first we save 30 minutes or (60% * 30 minutes) 18 minutes
