## Hi! {#hi}

I'm [Alex](https://www.alexday.me) and these are my notes that I keep using [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam). This site is largely (everything except the notes) taken from [Jethro](https://braindump.jethro.dev/)'s braindump.

I also haven't made good entrypoints to my brain yet, but you can start by going to the
[full index](/posts/).

Enjoy
