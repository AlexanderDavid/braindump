-   A random variable \\(X\\), represents an event whose outcome is unknown
-   \\(P\\) is a probability distribution that assigns weight to outcomes
    -   \\(X=\\) weather tomorrow
    -   \\(X \in \\{sunshine, rain, thunder\\}\\)
    -   \\(P(X=sunshine)=0.5\\), \\(P(X=rain) = 0.25\\), \\(P(X=thunder) = 0.25\\)
-   Probabilities are non-neg and sum to one
-   As we get more evidence the probabilities may change
-   The **expected value**, \\(E\\), of a function of a random variable is the average, weighted by the probability distribution over outcomes
