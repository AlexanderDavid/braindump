## Introduction {#introduction}

Text summarization can be broadly split into two categories:


### Abstractive {#abstractive}

Produce sentences that represent the document without using sentences from the document. Generate new words and phrases to summarize


### Extractive {#extractive}

Extract sentences already present within the document and present the ones that are most representative of the document
