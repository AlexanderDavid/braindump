-   Models removal of nodes from a network with its' adjacent edges
    -   Router failure
    -   Human dies
-   This is parameterized by **occupation probability** \\(\phi\\)
-   **Percolation transition**: When &phi; is lare there is a giant component in the graph. As &phi; decreases the giant component breaks down into many smaller componenets


## Random Percolation {#random-percolation}

-   Consider a configuration model with some [Degree Distributions]({{< relref "20201030102557-degree_distributions" >}}) \\(p\_k\\) and an occupation probability &phi;
-   Consider node \\(i\\) which
    -   Can belong to giant component
    -   is not in thhe giant component

        -   if \\(\text{deg}(i) = k\\) then the total probability that it is not connected to a giant component it \\(u^k\\)
        -   \\(u\\) is the probabilty that a vertex is not connected to the giant component by a particular neighbor
        -   Average probability of not being in the gc

        \begin{eqnarray}
        \label{eq:1}
        \Sigma\_{k} p\_{k} u^{k} = g\_{0}(u)
        \end{eqnarray}

        -   Calculating \\(u\\)
            1.  \\(i\\) is connected to \\(j\\) which is removed with probability \\(1 - \phi\\)
            2.  or \\(j\\) is not removed with prob &phi; but it is not in the giant component

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:2}
\math{Pr}[i \notin gc \text{ via } j] = 1 - \phi + \phi u^{k}
\end{eqnarray}

\\(u = 1 - \phi + \phi g\_{1}(u)\\)

-   Can try to solve this graphically
