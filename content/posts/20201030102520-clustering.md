A triangle is a complete subgraph of \\(G\\) with 3 vertices

\\(\lambda(G)\\) is the number of traingles in \\(G\\)

\\(\lambda(v)\\) is defined accordingly \\(\lambda(G) = \frac{1}{3} \Sigma\_{v}\lambda(v)\\)

A truple is a subgraph of \\(G\\) with 3 nodes and 2 edges

A truple is a triple at v if v is incident with both edges

We define clustering coefficient as \\(c(v) = \frac{\lambda(v)}{\tau(v)}\\)

Given \\(V'={v \in V | d(v) >= 2}\\) we define the clustering coefficient of \\(G\\) as:
    -   {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2020-10-01_09-52-19_screenshot.png" >}}

Transivity of \\(G\\) is defined as:
