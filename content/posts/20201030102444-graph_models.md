Random Model
    -   Model \\(G(n, m)\\) is a probability distribution \\(P(G)\\) over all graphs with \\(n\\) nodes and \\(m\\) edges
    -   Properties of model = properties of ensemble
    -   Examples
        -   Graph diameter \\(l(G)\\) means
            -   \\(\langle l \rangle = \Sigma\_{G}P(G)l(g) = \frac{1}{\Omega} \Sigma\_{G}l(G)\\)
        -   degree \\(\langle d(\cdot) \rangle = \frac{2m}{n}\\)

GNP Model \\(G(n, p)\\), graphs with \\(n\\) nodes and independent probability \\(p\\) for edge b/w two nodes
    -   Proprties of model = properties of ensemble wheere graph with \\(m\\) edges appears with probability:

    -   And prob of drawing a graph with \\(m\\) edges is

Giant Component in GNP
    -   Giant component is a network component whose size grows in proportion to \\(n\\)
