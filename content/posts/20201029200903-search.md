## Uninformed Search {#uninformed-search}


### Breadth First Search {#breadth-first-search}

-   Expand shallowest node first
-   Frontier is a FIFO queue


### Depth First Search {#depth-first-search}

-   Always expand the deepest node first
-   Frontier is a LIFO queue (stack)


### Iterative Deepening {#iterative-deepening}

-   Run DFS with depth limit 1
-   Run DFS with depth limit 2
-   Run DFS with depth limit ...
-   DFS space complexity with BFS time complexity


### Uniform Cost Search {#uniform-cost-search}

-   Expand least-cost node first
-   Frontier is a priority queue
-   Issues
    -   Explores in all directions
    -   No goal-oriented expansion


### Search Algorithm Evaluation {#search-algorithm-evaluation}

-   Completeness - Does this always find a solution if one exists
-   Optimal - Find the least cost solution
-   Time complexity - Time taken
-   Space complexity - Space needed
-   Useful quantities
    -   \\(b\\) - branching factor of the tree (average number of successors for any node)
    -   \\(m\\) - Maximum depth of the state space (meaning there are at max \\(b^m\\) nodes)
    -   \\(d\\) - Depth of the shallowest goal node

<!--list-separator-->

-  BFS Properties

    -   Time complexity \\(\approx O(b^d)\\)
    -   Space complexity \\(\approx O(b^d)\\)
    -   It is complete (if \\(d\\) is finite)
    -   It is optimal only if step costs are equal or increasing as we move down the tree
    -   BFS requires a crazy amount of memory and time

<!--list-separator-->

-  DFS Properties

    -   It is complete if \\(m\\) is finite and the graph is acyclic
    -   Not optimal
    -   Time complexity \\(O(b^m)\\) if \\(m \ne \infty\\) and terrible if \\(m >> d\\)
    -   Space complexity \\(O(bm)\\)

<!--list-separator-->

-  UCS properties

    -   It is optimal
    -   It is complete if the cost of every action is at least \\(\epsilon > 0\\)
    -   Time
        -   If \\(C^\*\\) is the optimal cost the effective depth is \\(\frac{C^\*}{\epsilon}\\)
        -   It takes \\(O(b^{\frac{C^\*}{\epsilon}})\\) time and space


## Informed Search {#informed-search}

-   **Informed Search Methods** use problem specific knowledge to solve a problem better
-   **Idea**: Use an _evaluation_ function \\(f(n)\\) for each node \\(n\\)
    -   Estimate "desirability" of each node
-   Open is a priority queue sorted by increasing $f$-cost


### Search Heuristic {#search-heuristic}

-   A heuristic function \\(h(n)\\)
    -   Estimates how close the state at node \\(n\\) is to the goal state
    -   Designed for a particular search problem
    -   Common heuristics: Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, etc.


### Greedy Search {#greedy-search}

-   Expand the node that appears to be closest to the goal at each step
-   \\(f(n)=h(n)\\)
-   Complete
-   Not Optimal
-   Time - \\(O(b^m)\\)
-   Space - \\(O(b^m)\\)


### A\* {#a}

-   Guide the search while avoid expanding expensive paths
-   Evaluation function \\(f(n)  = g(n) + h(n)\\)
-   Admissible heuristics
    -   Never overestimate true cost of the goal
-   Consistent heuristics
    -   \\(h(n) <= c(n, a, n')+h(n')\\)
    -   Where \\(c\\) is a step cost function
    -   All consistent heuristics are admissible
-   Most of the work in A\* lies on finding admissible heuristics
    -   We can often find these by solving a _relaxed_ version of the problem
        -   The **key** idea is the optimal solution cost of the relaxed problem is no greater than the optimal solution cost of the real problem
-   Given two heuristics \\(h\_1\\) and \\(h\_2\\) if \\(h\_{2}(n) >= h\_{1}(n) \forall n\\) then \\(h\_2\\) **dominates** \\(h\_1\\) and is better for search
-   Given \\(m\\) admissible heuristics \\(h\_1, h\_2, \dots, h\_3\\) then \\(h(n) = max(h\_1(n), h\_2(n), \dots, h\_n(n))\\) is also admissable and dominates any \\(h\_i\\)
-   A\* has extensions that allow incremental, anytime, and pruning approahces
