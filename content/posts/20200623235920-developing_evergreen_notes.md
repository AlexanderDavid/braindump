[Evergreen notes]({{< relref "20200623233650-evergreen_notes" >}}) don't just appear fully formed in your database. You have to go through an evolution:

1.  Stubs defined through backlinks
    A page can be defined by the context it is linked to, even if that page has no context.
2.  Simple definitions
3.  Exact notes on a specific subject
4.  High level abstract note

The evergreen note doesn't have to go through these explicit steps but this is a solid route to evergreen-ness
