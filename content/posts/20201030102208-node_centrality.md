-   Q: What are the most important nodes and edges
    -   A: The modes with the highest centrality
    -   There are many ways to determine centrality
        -   Degree Centrality - Number of connections
        -   Closeness centrality - Average distance to each node
        -   Edge removal centrality - What happens to some metric on the graph when this edge is removed


## Eccentricity {#eccentricity}

-   \\(\forall i \in V\\) we define \\(e(i) = max\\{\delta\_{ij}|j \in V\\}\\)
-   Eccentricity centrality \\(c\_{E}(i)=\frac{1}{e(i)}\\)
-   The eccentricity centrality of a node is 1 over the longest path that the node is connected to
-   Important with roads (hospital placement) and other domains


## Eigenvector Centrality {#eigenvector-centrality}

-   A nodes importance is defined by the sum of all its neighbors degrees up to some depth \\(t\\)

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2020-09-03_16-54-55_screenshot.png" >}}

-   \\(x^{(t)} = A^tx^{(0)}\\)
-   Rewrite \\(x^{(0)}\\) as a linear combo of eigenvectors of \\(A\\)
    -   \\(x^{(t)}=A^t\Sigma\_ic\_iv\_i=\Sigma\_ic\_iA^tv\_i=\Sigma\_ic\_i\lambda^t\_iv\_i\\)


## PageRank {#pagerank}

-   Similar mathamatically and computationally to Eigenvalue
-   Billion Dollar Centrality (Google started with this idea for web page ranking)
-   Indicates a nodes importance with random probability of visiting a node while surfing the web
-   We create a **transition matrix** for the random surfer denoted as \\(P\\)
-   Markov Chains give us the probabilities of visiting the pages after \\(k\\) steps is \\(P^kx\\) where \\(x\\) is the probability of the surfer starting at each node
-   **Problem: **dangling nodes**** \\(d^+(i)=0\\)
-   **Solution:** damping factor \\(\alpha\\) (usually small) and used for random teleportation
    -   \\(P^\prime=(1- \alpha )P+\alpha T\\) where

        \begin{equation}
            T = \frac{1}{n}
            \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & \cdots & 1 \\\\\\
            \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\\\
            1 & \cdots & 1
            \end{pmatrix}
        \end{equation}
-   This is equivalent to solving the eigenproblem \\(P'v=v\\)
-   Solving is very expensive because this is a dense matrix with no non-zero entries
-   Iterative computation for solving the system with \\(P'\\) is less expensive
-   The principal eigenvector of \\(P'\\) is a PageRank


## Hubs and Authorities {#hubs-and-authorities}

-   In some cases a vertex may be important if it points to others with high centrality
    -   X sends information to many leaders who don't know X , i.e. X is influential
    -   Scientific paper citations: A review article (hub) may cite other articles (authorities) that are authoritative sources for information
-   **Authorities** - Nodes that contain useful information
-   **Hubs** - Nodes that point to the best Authorities
-   \\(A\\) is an adj matrix
-   \\(\vec{x}\\) - authorities and \\(\vec{y}\\) - hubs
-   Node \\(i\\) gets some \\(\vec{x\_i}\\) value which is the authoritativeness and then \\(\vec{y\_i}\\) is the hub-ness of node \\(i\\)
-   \\(\vec{x\_i} = \alpha \Sigma\_{j} A\_{ij} \vec{y\_j}\\) where \\(\alpha\\) is some scaling factor
-   \\(\vec{y\_i} = \beta \Sigma\_j A\_{ji} \vec{x\_j}\\) where \\(\beta\\) is some scaling factor
-   Solve for \\[\vec{x\_i}\\] by plugging it in
-   \\(\vec{x\_i} = \alpha \beta \Sigma\_j A\_{ij} A\_{ji} \vec{x\_j}\\)
-   \\(AA^t\vec{x} = (\alpha \beta)^{-1} \vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x}\\)
-   \\(A^TA\vec{y}=\lambda \vec{y}\\)
-   This is called the ****HITS**** algorithm
-   Introduced in [Authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment]({{< relref "kleinberg1999authoritative" >}})


## Closeness Centrality {#closeness-centrality}

-   \\(\delta\_{ij} =\\) length of \\(i-j\\) shortest path
-   \\(\forall i \in V C\_i = \frac{1}{l\_i}\\), where \\(l\_i=\frac{1}{n}\Sigma\_{j \in V} \delta\_{ij}\\)
-   Problems:
    -   Graphs with multiple components
        -   Solution: Harmonic mean distance centrality
        -   \\(\forall i \in V C'\_{i} = \frac{1}{n-1} \Sigma\_{j \ne i} \frac{1}{\delta\_{ij}}\\)
    -   In real life networks the paths are normally relatively small
        -   Six degrees of separation
        -   Internet Movie Database
            -   Highest centrality = 0.4143, lowest centrality = 0.1154
            -   Does not span a large range
    -   Highly sensitive (one edge removal and all distances are increased)
    -   Geodesic distances are integers, **often small because distance increases with the log of the network size**
-   Useful for geographic networks without shortcuts
-   Not useful for networks with shortcuts (like internet)


## Enumeration of Shortest Paths-based Centrality {#enumeration-of-shortest-paths-based-centrality}

-   \\(\sigma\_{st}(i)\\) is a number of s-t shortest paths containing i
-   \\(\sigma\_{st}\\) is a number of all s-t shortest paths
-   **Observation**: In practice communication or transport in networks follow different kinds of paths that tend to be the shortest
    -   How much _work_ can be done by a node?


### Stress Centrality {#stress-centrality}

-   Measures the amount of communication that passes through a node/edge
-   For nodes:
    \\(c\_S(i) = \Sigma\_{s \neq  i} \Sigma\_{t \neq i} \sigma\_{st}(i)\\)
-   For edges:
    \\(c\_S(ij) = \Sigma\_{s \in  V} \Sigma\_{t \in V} \sigma\_{st}(ij)\\)


### Betweeness Centrality {#betweeness-centrality}

-   \\(c\_B(i) = \Sigma\_{s\neq i} \Sigma\_{t \neq i} \frac{\sigma\_{st}(i)}{\sigma\_{st}}\\)
-   \\(c\_B(ij) = \Sigma\_{s \in  V} \Sigma\_{t \in V} \frac{\sigma\_{st}(ij)}{\sigma{st}}\\)
-   Stress Centrality but normalized by the total number of shortest paths. This allows us to compare the values between nodes and between graphs
-   Introduced in [A set of measures of centrality based on betweenness]({{< relref "freeman1977set" >}})


### Problems {#problems}

-   BC is extremely sensitive to network dynamics (edge/node removal/addition)
    -   \\(\epsilon-\\) BC: Replace all short shortest paths with some other value


## Traversal Sets {#traversal-sets}

-   \\(\forall ij \in E\\) we define the edge's traversal set \\(T\_{ij} = \\{(s, t) \in V \times V | \text{ some shortest path s-t contains } ij\\}\\)
-   and the traversal set induced graph:
    \\(G[T\_{ij}]=(V', E')\\), where \\(V'=\\{k \in V | (k, t) \in T\_ij \vee (s, k) \in T\_{ij}\\}\\), and \\(E^{\prime} = \\{(s, t) \in T\_{ij}\\}\\)
-   \\(|T\_{ij}|\\) is a good measure
-   Another measure based on \\(T\_{ij}\\) is the edge centrality index:
    \\(c\_{ts}(ij) = |H|\text{, where H is a minimum vertex cover in } G[T\_{ij}]\\)
-   that can be used in characterization of networks with hierarchical organization
-   **Note** There is a thm that states: ina bipartite graphs the min size of a vertex cover = the size of a maximum matching


### Example of Hierarchical Organization {#example-of-hierarchical-organization}

-   Transportation Roads Density


## Feedback Centrality {#feedback-centrality}

-   Simple, directed \\(G\\), no loops
    -   \\(\vorall i \in V c\_K(i) = \Sigma^{\infty}\_{k=1}\Sigma^n\_{j=1}\alpha\_k(A^k)ji\\)
    -   The sum converges with restricted with \\(\alpha\_k\\)
    -   ****Theorem****: If \\(A\\) is the adj matrix of \\(G\\), \\(\alpha > 0\\), and \\(\lambda\_1\\) the largest eigenvalue of \\(A\\), then
        -   \\(\lambda\_1<\frac{1}{\alpha} \iff \Sigma^{\infty}\_{k=1}\alpha^k A^k\\) converges
        -   and \\(c\_K=(I-\alpha A)^{-1} \cdot \textbb{1}\_n\\)


## Network Flow {#network-flow}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2020-09-10_09-43-57_screenshot.png" >}}

-   The flow within the network is given by the following eqns
    -   Capacity: \\(\forall e \in E: 0 <= f(e) <= u(e)\\) (The flow through an edge must not exceed the capacity of the edge)
    -   Balance \\(\vorall v \in V {s, t}: \Sigma\_{e \in \Gamma^-(v)}f(e) = \Sigma\_{e \in \Gamma^+(v)}f(e)\\) (The flow if the in must be the flow of the out edges for all nodes except s and t (start and terminate))
-   The value of the flow \\(f\\) is defined as \\(\Sigma\_{e \in \Gamma^+(s)} f(e)\\)
-   Computing the flow is \\(O(nm \log{\frac{n^2}{m}})\\)
-   Ford-Fulkerson thm says that the value of a maximum s-t-flow = the capacity of the minimum s-t-cut.


## Vitality (robustness) {#vitality--robustness}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2020-09-10_09-52-52_screenshot.png" >}}

-   What happens with the network if we remove some network from the element


### Max-flow Betweenness Vitality {#max-flow-betweenness-vitality}

-   How much flow must go over a vertex \\(i\\) in order to obtain the maximum flow value? How much does the objective function change if we remove \\(i\\) from the network?

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2020-09-10_09-54-39_screenshot.png" >}}


### Closeness Vitality {#closeness-vitality}

-   Wiener index of a network
    \\(I\_w(G)=\Sigma\_{i,j\inV}\sigma\_{ij}\\)
    or in terms of closeness
    \\(I\_w(G)=n \cdot \Sigma\_{i \in V}\frac{1}{C\_i}\\)
    Closeness vitality is defined on both vertecies and edges
    \\(c\_{CV}(x)=I\_W(G)-I\_W(G \textbackslash \\{x\\})\\)


### Stress Centrality as a Vitality Index {#stress-centrality-as-a-vitality-index}

-   \\(\sigma\_{st}(i)\\) is the number of s-t shortest paths containing \\(i\\)
-   \\(\sigma\_{st}\\) is the number of all s-t shortest paths
-   \\(c\_S(i) = \Sigma\_{s \neq i}\Sigma\_{t \neq i}\sigma{st}(i)\\)
-   \\(c\_S(ij)=\Sigma\_{s \in V}\Sigma{t \in V}\sigma\_{st}(ij)\\)
-   Can be interpreted as the # of shortest paths that are lost if a vertex or edge is removed from the graph
-   However, when you remove an edge you might increase the number of shortest paths


## Current Flow {#current-flow}

-   Introduced in [A measure of betweenness centrality based on random walks]({{< relref "newman2005measure" >}})

### Normalization in different networks {#normalization-in-different-networks}

-   Point centrality
    ![](/ox-hugo/2020-09-10_10-18-09_screenshot.png)
-   Examples
    -   Degree centrality = normalization by factor of (n-1)
