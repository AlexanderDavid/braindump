In many big systems a scale gap can be observed between micro and macroscopic scales because of the difference in physical models and/or laws at different scale. The most well known example is in physics.

Multiscale methods are a class of techniques for efficiently solving large-scale computationsal optimization problems. Recursively construct  sequence of descriptions at increasingly courser scales to approximate the system
