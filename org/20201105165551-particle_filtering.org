* Why Particle Filtering?
- Sometimes $|X|$ is too big to use exact inference
  + $|X|$ may be too big to even store $B(X)$
  + E.g. X is continuous
* What is Particle Filtering?
- A way of narrowing down the state space for filtering using [[file:hidden-markov-models.org][Hidden Markov Models]]
- Approximate inference using samples (particles)
- Track samples of X not all values
- Time per step: $O(|\text{particles}|)$
  + But the number may be large
- In memory: list of particles not states
- Aka Monte Carlo filter, Survival of the fittest, Bootstrap filter
* Particles
- $B(X_t) = P(X_{t}|e_{1:t})$ is now a list of samples ${x_{t}^{1}, x_{t}^{2}, \dots, x_{t}^{N}}$
  + Generally N << |X|
  + Storing map from X to counts would defeat the point
* Step 1: Time Update
- Problem
  + Given ${x_{t}^{1}, x_{t}^{2}, \dots, x_{t}^{N}}$ approximating $B(X_{t})$, find the next set of particles
- Solution
  + Move each particle by sampling it's next position from the transition model
