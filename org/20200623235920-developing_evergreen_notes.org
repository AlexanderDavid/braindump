[[file:20200623233650-evergreen_notes.org][Evergreen notes]] don't just appear fully formed in your database. You have to go through an evolution:
1. Stubs defined through backlinks
   A page can be defined by the context it is linked to, even if that page has no context.
2. Simple definitions
3. Exact notes on a specific subject
4. High level abstract note

The evergreen note doesn't have to go through these explicit steps but this is a solid route to evergreen-ness
