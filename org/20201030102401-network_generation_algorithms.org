- Method of generation for specific networks
- Used to test metrics and evaluate if they apply to multiple types of networks
* Price Model
- Modelled citations
- New nodes randomly attach to nodes with a prob proportional to the number of citations the paper already had
- A new paper needs a random non-zero chance of getting cited
* Barabasi-Albert
- Similar to price model but undirected
- Can have non-linear preferential attachment
* Vertex Copying Model
- Same as Price but we copy one of the existing nodes and part of its citations
* Network Optimization
- Some networks are optimized over time
- Minimize shortest path or other prefered metric
* Small World Model
- Aims to maximize clustering
- Adding shortcuts to circle model
** Watts-Strogatz
- Given circle model
- Remove Edge
- Add new randomly uniform
* R-Mat Generator
- Generate empty adjacency matrix of a graph and then recursively split into segments (based on assigned probabilities)
- When some final cell is chosen place an edge between two nodes
- We can add community "clusters" by increasing the probability
