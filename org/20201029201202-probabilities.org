- A random variable $X$, represents an event whose outcome is unknown
- $P$ is a probability distribution that assigns weight to outcomes
  - $X=$ weather tomorrow
  - $X \in \{sunshine, rain, thunder\}$
  - $P(X=sunshine)=0.5$, $P(X=rain) = 0.25$, $P(X=thunder) = 0.25$
- Probabilities are non-neg and sum to one
- As we get more evidence the probabilities may change
- The *expected value*, $E$, of a function of a random variable is the average, weighted by the probability distribution over outcomes
