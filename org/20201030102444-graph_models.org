- Random Model
  + Model $G(n, m)$ is a probability distribution $P(G)$ over all graphs with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges
  + Properties of model = properties of ensemble
  + Examples
    - Graph diameter $l(G)$ means
      + $\langle l \rangle = \Sigma_{G}P(G)l(g) = \frac{1}{\Omega} \Sigma_{G}l(G)$
    - degree $\langle d(\cdot) \rangle = \frac{2m}{n}$
- GNP Model $G(n, p)$, graphs with $n$ nodes and independent probability $p$ for edge b/w two nodes
  + Proprties of model = properties of ensemble wheere graph with $m$ edges appears with probability:

  + And prob of drawing a graph with $m$ edges is

- Giant Component in GNP
  + Giant component is a network component whose size grows in proportion to $n$
