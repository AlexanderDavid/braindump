#+roam_keys: Summarization

* Introduction
Text summarization can be broadly split into two categories:
** Abstractive
Produce sentences that represent the document without using sentences from the document. Generate new words and phrases to summarize
** Extractive
Extract sentences already present within the document and present the ones that are most representative of the document
