- A triangle is a complete subgraph of $G$ with 3 vertices
- $\lambda(G)$ is the number of traingles in $G$
- $\lambda(v)$ is defined accordingly $\lambda(G) = \frac{1}{3} \Sigma_{v}\lambda(v)$
- A truple is a subgraph of $G$ with 3 nodes and 2 edges
- A truple is a triple at v if v is incident with both edges

- We define clustering coefficient as $c(v) = \frac{\lambda(v)}{\tau(v)}$
- Given $V'={v \in V | d(v) >= 2}$ we define the clustering coefficient of $G$ as:

- Transivity of $G$ is defined as:
