- $p_k$ is the probability that a randomly chosen node has a degree $k$
- Classical undirected random graph models $G_{n,p}$
  + Each node is connected independently with probability $p$ to $n-1$ nodes

      - When n is large, mean degree is approximately constant
- What if the network is large?
  + Mean degree is approximately constant $c$
  + let $p=\frac{c}{n-1}$
  + $(1-p)^{n-1-k}=e^{-c}$
  + $p_k = \frac{(np)^k}{k!}e^{-np}$
- Eigenvector and betweenness centrality roughly correlate with degree in the powerlaw distribution
