- The tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others
  + Examples: Social networks, citation networks, web page langauges, animals
- /Disassortative Mixing/ - Opposite to assortative
** Discrete
- $c_i$ - type of vertex $i$
- $\delta(i,j)$ - Kronnecker delta
- $q=\frac{1}{2}\Sigma_{ij}A_{aj}\delta(c_i, c_j) - \frac{1}{2}\Sigma_{ij}\frac{d(i)d(j)}{2m}\delta(c_i, c_j)$
  + TOtal number of edges between similar vertexes
  + Expected number of edges between similar vertexes in a random model
- $Q = q/m$ is called the /modularity/
- Modularity is a measure of the extent to which like is connected to like in a network
* Scalar

* Modularity Maximization
- Easy way to cluster
- Iterative algorithm $O(mn)$
- Spectral Modularity Maximization
