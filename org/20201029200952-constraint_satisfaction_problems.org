* Constraint Graph
** Independence
- Different components can have independent solutions
** Tree
- Thm: If the constraint graph is a tree it can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(nd^2)$ time
** Iterative Improvement
- Keep some local state that you try to improve
- Fast and memory-efficient but  bsincomplete and sub optimal
- Combine multiple local states and then randomly try and fix all conflicts
