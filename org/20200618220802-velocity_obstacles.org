Velocity Obstacles are a way to determine collision velocities for agents.

Imagine starting with a Cartesian space where there are two agents, $A$ and $B$.

Now if you translate this space so that $A$ is centered at the origin and $B$ is at position $x_{b}-x_{a}$.

Now if you deflate $A$ so that it is a single point, then inflate $B$ so it has a has a radius of $r_{a}+r_{b}$ (because $A$ is a point and the radius has to be increased).

By doing this you calculate the Minkowski sum. Remember the Minkowsi sum $X \oplus Y = \{ x + y | x \in X, y \in Y \}$. So if $X$ is the position of $A$ ($\{[0, 0]\}$), and $Y$ is the position of $B$ ($\{[1, 1]\}$). Then $X \oplus Y = \{[1, 1]\}$.

If we take that same 2d plane but change the $X$ and $Y$ axis and change them to velocities (by dividing everything by one second).

Now every point in this space denotes a velocity. The question now is what is the set of velocities that will lead to a collision. This set is the $VO_{A|B}$, or the velocity obstacle of $A$ induced by $B$.

To find if a some velocity $\vec{V}_{1}$ is a collision velocity then have it define a ray starting at the origin and passing through $\vec{V}_1$. If this ray intersects the disk then it is a collision velocity. Writing the point of intersection in the form of $\tau \vec{V}_{1}$ where $\tau$ is some constant gives you the time til collision.

** Revising definition
:PROPERTIES:

The velocity obstacle can be geometrically defined as the following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
VO_{{A|B}} = \{ \vec{v} | \exists \tau \ge 0 : \tau \vec{v} \cap \in D(x_{B} -_{} x_{A}, r_{A} + r_{B}) \ne \emptyset\}
\end{equation}

In English this means that the velocity obstacle of A induced by B is the set of all velocities such that there exists a constant $\tau \ge 0$ such that $\tau \vec{v}$ is within the disk centered at $x_{B}-x_{A}$ with radius $r_{A}+r_{B}$.

This definition gives a cone with its apex at the origin and its sides running tangent to the disk.

** Time Horizon Velocity Obstacle
A time horizon Velocity Obstacle is a $VO$ that describes velocities that will lead to a collision between time $0$ and some time $\tau_{{H}}$. This is useful if you don't care about collisions that will happen far in the future.

Given two agents, $A$ and $B$, the velocity obstacle $VO^{\tau_{H}}_{A|B}$ (read: the velocity obstacle of $A$ induced by $B$ for time horizon $\tau_{H}$) is the set of all velocities that  $A$ can take that will lead to a collision between $A$ and $B$ at some moment within the next $\tau_{H}$ seconds. The geometric definition is as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    VO^{\tau_{H}}_{A|B} = \{ v | \exists \tau \in [0, \tau_{H}]: \tau V \cap \in D(x_{B} - X_{A}, r_{A} + r_{B}) \ne \emptyset \}
\end{equation}

In english this means that the velocity obstacle, $VO$, for a time horizon $\tau_{H}$ induced on $A$ by $B$ is equal to all velocities such that a $\tau$ exists between $0$ and $\tau_{H}$ (inclusive) such that $\tau V$ unioned with the disk centered at $X_{B} - X_{A}$ with radius $r_{A} + r_{B}$ is not empty.

Geometrically, this $VO$ is still a cone (assuming circular agents). But this cone is truncated by a disk of radius $\frac{r_{A} + r_{B}}{\tau_{H}}$ and centered at $\frac{x_{A} - x_{B}}{\tau_{H}}$ compared to the $VO$ discussed above.
