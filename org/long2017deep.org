** Testing
*** Scenarios
- Crossing ::  agents  are  separated  in  two  groups,  and  theirpath will intersect in the bottom left corner;
- Circle :: agents are initially located along a circle and eachagentâ€™s goal is to reach its antipodal position;
- Swap :: two groups of agents moving in opposite directionsswap their positions;
- Random :: agents  are  randomly  initialized  in  a  clutteredenvironment and are assigned random goals;
- 3 Obstacles :: six agents move across three obstacles;
- 1  Obstacle ::  four  agents  initialized  on  a  circle  movetowards  their  antipodal  positions,  and  an  obstacle  islocated at the center.
