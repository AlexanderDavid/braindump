The eBuy system is a system provided by the US Government that allows federal agencies to request quotes for services under Multi-Award contracts and technology contracts (GSA Schedule 70 (IT), Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and Network Services and Telecommunications)

The GSA RFQs (Request for Quote, which is a [[file:20200617135420-gsa_forms.org][GSA Forms]]) are posted under a specific GSA Schedule Special Item Number (SIN) category for Multi-Award Schedules or GWAC/Network Services and Telecommunications functional catagories.

Companies registered with the eBuy system return the RFQs and once the RFQ period expires the buyer evaluates which quote to go with.
