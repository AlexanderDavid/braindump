* Markov Model
    - Markov models are defined by
      + Some states $X$
      + Initial Distribution $P(X_{_{1}})$
      + Transitions $P({X_{t}|X{t-1})$
    - Basic conditional independence
      + Past and future independent given the present
      + Each time step only depends on the previous
      + First order markov property
    - Example
        [[file:images/2020-10-29_17-04-00_screenshot.png]]
      + $P(x_{1})$ known
      + $P(X_{t}) = \Sigma_{x_{t-1}}P(X_{t}, X_{t-1}=x_{t-1}) = \Sigma_{x_{t-1}}P(X_{t}|X_{t-1}=x_{t-1})P(x_{t-1})$
    - Markov models come to convergence at some $t$
      + This is called the stationary distribution or $P_{\infty}$
      + $P_{\infty}(X) = P_{\infty + 1}(X)$
