#+title: Data Visualization (Fall 2020)

* Dataset Information
** Dataset
- Graph
- Table
- Fields
- Geometry

*Note*: Each item in a dataset also has a Data Type (position for geometry, attribute for others, etc.)

** Data
- Categorical
  - Can only check equality
- Ordinal
  - Can establish some order
- Quantitative
  - Can do some sort of math on them (average, sum, range, etc.)

** Examples
*** Example 1
Dataset is a graph. The nodes (countries) have an attribute which is their total spending (floating point number) and then an edge between the nodes has a weight that denotes the percentage of total spending that goes to that country (floating point number between 0 and 1). This dataset contains self-edges to denote reinvestment. This dataset could also be represented as a table but the table would use more memory than the graph would.

*** Example 2
The dataset type is tabular. The table has 3 columns for each salary. An categorical string for the job type (Legal, Management, etc.), a ordinal year for each expense, and a quantitative expense cost. I like the way this data is represented as it is easy to see the different "tiers" of job pay. For example it seems like there is a strong band at around $87k-ish. However when the data is heavily clustered it seems like some datapoints can be pushed around.

* Marks and Channels
Jumping straight to how to visualize
** Marks
Basic graphical element visualized as a geometric primitive. This decides the graphical appearance of each attribute in a dataset.
*** Items
- Points
- Lines
- Areas
*** Links
- Containment
- Connection
** Channels
Represent how the marks will be displayed in the final visualization.
- Position
  + Horizontal
  + Vertical
  + Both
- Color
- Shape
- Tilt
- Size
  + Length
  + Area
  + Volume
** Gestalt Laws
- Rules to describe the way we see patterns in visual displays
- Translate into useful sets of rules for visual design
- 8 laws:
  1. Proximity
     - Things that are closer together are perceptually grouped together
  2. Similarity
     - Color can really take the lead and pop out that objects share similarities
  3. Connectedness
     - Links between objects
  4. Continuity
  5. Symmetry
  6. Closure
  7. Alignment
** Color in Data Visualizations
- 3 different things we can modulate
*** Luminance
- Well suited for ordered data
- Low accuracy for non-contiguous regions with similar luminance
- Small number of discriminable steps (less than 5)
*** Saturation
- Well suited for ordered data
- Around 3 discriminable steps
- Saturation interacts with the size channel
- Saturation and hue are not separable channels within small regions
*** Hue
** Color Map
- Mapping from values to color
- Can be:
  + Categorical vs Ordered
  + Sequential vs Diverging
  + Segmented vs Continuous
  + Univariate vs Bivariate
